> First of all, I want to say special thanks to [chronark.com](https://chronark.com) as the initial creator of the website and allows clones/forks by other people.

My personal website, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [Upstash](https://upstash.com), [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev) and deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

Like so many others, I just wanted a place to collect some projects I worked on. Maybe I'll add a blog, maybe I won't. I'm not sure yet.

If you like the design, check out the repository on [my GitHub](https://github.com/dodyagung/dodyagung.com) or [chronark's GitHub](https://github.com/chronark/chronark.com).
